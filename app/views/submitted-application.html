        <p class="govuk-body-s">From a young age, I have had a keen interest in reading crime novels by authors such as James Patterson. To gain more insight into the legalities of criminal justice system, I have spent some time at The Old Bailey Court, where I sat through hearings and legal proceedings. This encouraged me to try and understand how this process operates, and this is how I discovered my interest in criminology. Furthermore, through sitting in a public trial I managed to identify the various job roles that influenced the final verdict. This was interesting as it highlighted potential career paths I could follow.
          Outside of academic learning, I am an active member in the school community. As a Prefect, I am responsible for organising events. This has given me the opportunity to listen to other people’s opinions. This has also helped me to become a more conscientious worker. My part-time job has allowed me to gain confidence in myself whilst working as an individual and also as a crucial team member. From this I have developed skills such as decision making, critical thinking and working under pressure. These are all skills I believe to be necessary for successfully completing a degree.
